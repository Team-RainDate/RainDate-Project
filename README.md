## RainDate: Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning                                                                                   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/python/python.png" alt="Python" height="40" style="vertical-align:top; margin:4px">

RainDate is a web-application used for prediction of monthly rainfall in specified regions of Bhutan. RainDate takes parameters such as Max Temperature, Min Temperature, Relative humidity, and Windspeed to predict monthly amount rainfall in millimeter of specified region selected by users.

**Why RainDate?**
1. The accurate and precise rainfall prediction is still lacking which could assist in diverse fields like agriculture, water reservation, and flood prediction.

2. RainDate works on the previous findings and similarities to give the output predictions that are reliable and appropriate. 

3. To solve problems related to road transportation and aviation as the travelers will be informed accurately and efficiently. 

**How does it work?**
The SVM (Support Vector Machine) algirithm is trained to predict monthly rainfall using following parameters:

- Maximum Temperature
- Minimum Temperature 
- Relative Humidity
- Windspeed
- Month 
- Year
- Locations
